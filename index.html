<p>As the popularity of private messaging platforms continues to rise for news consumption, quite a few news organisations have set themselves on platforms like WhatsApp to publish news round-ups, to engage with local audiences and to provide fact-checking services.</p>
<p>So, how do you get started if you want to set up your organisation on WhatsApp?</p>
<p>First thing you need to do is either download the WhatsApp Business App (available for both Apple or Android), or sign up for a WhatsApp Business API (on desktop). The app will suffice for smaller projects, but the API is recommended for medium and larger ones. The app does not require a company URL, but the API does.</p>
<p>What you will need before going any further is a business mobile number to use for communications. If you use a number currently being used for a personal WhatsApp account, that number will change into a business account and it will transfer all existing chat history and media.</p>
<p>For this explanation, we will take a look primarily at using the WhatsApp Business app.</p>
<p>When you head in, you will be asked for a mobile number. The default choice will be the number associated to the device, but you can use a different one. It will ask for a six-digit verification code sent to the number you have inputted. Once that is submitted correctly, the number will be validated and you will be transferred into the app.</p>
<p>Once it loads, you will be asked to create a profile. It will ask for a business name and business category. Chose from the list. There is no current option for news or media, so the best choice for now is to select 'other'.</p>
